    Almighty and most merciful Father,<br/>
    we have erred and strayed from your ways like lost sheep.<br/>
    We have followed too much the devices and desires of our own hearts.<br/>
    We have offended against your holy laws.<br/>
    We have left undone those things which we ought to have done,<br/>
    and we have done those things which we ought not to have done;<br/>
    and apart from your grace, there is no health in us.<br/>
    O Lord, have mercy upon us.<br/>
    Spare all those who confess their faults.<br/>
    Restore all those who are penitent, according to your promises declared<br/>
    to all people in Christ Jesus our Lord;<br/>
    And grant, O most merciful Father, for his sake,<br/>
    that we may now live a godly, righteous, and sober life,<br/>
     to the glory of your holy Name. <i>Amen.</i><br/>

    <p>The Almighty and merciful Lord grant you absolution and remission of all your sins, true repentance, amendment of life, and the grace and consolation of his Holy Spirit. Amen.</p>
