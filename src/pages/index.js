    <p>For thousands of years, Christians have practiced the Daily Office as a way of devoting themselves to God. The essence of it is a structured way of praying and reading the Bible. Below are easily accessible liturgies as designated by the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net/">Anglican Church in North America (ACNA)</a>.</p>

    <ul>
    <li><span role="img" aria-label="night">ðŸŒƒ</span> <Link to="/compline/">Compline</Link> (night prayer)</li>
    </ul>
