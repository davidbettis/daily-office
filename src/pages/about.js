    <h1>What is the Daily Office?</h1>

    <p>The Daily Office is a structured way of reading the Bible and praying at set times during the day. It has its origins in monastic practice during the Middle Ages. An Anglican tradition, it was initially described by the Book of Common Prayer, published in 1549. This Daily Office liturgy uses the updated Book of Common Prayer <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net/?/main/texts_for_common_prayer">published</a> by the <a href="http://anglicanchurch.net">ACNA</a>.</p>

    <p>The Daily Office is composed of several different pieces: a lectionary (a schedule of reading the Bible), the psalter (a schedule of reading the Psalms), and a variety of prayers and readings from the Book of Common Prayer. Some of these prayers vary based on the day of the week. Other pieces of the liturgy vary based on the church calendar (the liturgical season). In any case, when reading through the guidelines, it can seem overwhelming! I built this web site to address these complexities.</p>

    <p>The website is intentionally not flashy, so as to encourage the reader to focus on the content.</p>

    <h1>How do you do it?</h1>

    <p>If you would like to create our own web site with the liturgy, the source for this project can be found on <a href="https://github.com/davidbettis/daily-office">Github</a>.</p>
