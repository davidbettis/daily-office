    <p>
    I believe in God, the Father almighty,<br/>
    creator of heaven and earth.<br/>
    I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.<br/>
    He was conceived by the Holy Spirit<br/>
    and born of the Virgin Mary.<br/>
    He suffered under Pontius Pilate,<br/>
    was crucified, died, and was buried.<br/>
    He descended to the dead.<br/>
    On the third day he rose again.<br/>
    He ascended into heaven,<br/>
    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.<br/>
    He will come again to judge the living and the dead.<br/>
    I believe in the Holy Spirit,<br/>
    the holy catholic Church,<br/>
    the communion of saints,<br/>
    the forgiveness of sins,<br/>
    the resurrection of the body,<br/>
    and the life everlasting. Amen.
