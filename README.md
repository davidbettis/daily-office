# Summary

This is a static website to vend the Daily Office as prescribed by the ACNA
(http://anglicanchurch.net/).  The Daily Office is an historic devotional,
which walks the reader through a set of readings from the Bible and various
prayers.

# TODO

## For all sections
* Move office-specific CSS outside of global CSS
* Add option for traditional / contemporary Lord's prayer

## Morning Prayer 

* Conditional Pascha Nostrum during 1st week of Easter
* The Lessons
    * Is it possible to bring in Bible passages? Is there a public domain edition of the Bible out there?
* "From Easter Day through the Day of Pentecost “Alleluia, alleluia” may be added to the preceding versicle and response."
* Opening sentences of scripture vary throughout the church year
* Consistent way to choose variable texts, like opening/closings
